4.	What is the difference between Union and Join? A join is used to combine columns from different tables whereas the union is used to combine rows.
5.	What is the difference between INNER JOIN and FULL JOIN? Inner join returns only the matching rows between both the tables, non-matching rows are eliminated. Full Join or Full Outer Join returns all rows from both the tables (left & right tables), including non-matching rows from both the tables
6.	What is difference between left join and outer join
7.	What is cross join? It creates a cartesian product between two tables.
8.	What is the difference between WHERE clause and HAVING clause? having applies only to groups as a whole, whereas applied to individual rows
